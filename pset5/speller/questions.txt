0.  It is the longest word in the dictionary.
1.  It returns resource usage measures for who, which can be either SELF, CHILDREN or THREAD.
2.  There are 16 variables of type struct rusage.
3.  We have to pass in reference in case &before or &after are NULL, to prevent an error.
4.  For each iteration, get a char c from a file pointed to by fp until you reach the EOF. If the char is an alphabetical letter or
    apostrophe, append the character to the array word. The word is ignored if it longer than the longest word defined or if it has 
    any digits. If a whole word is found, word count is incremented, the spelling is checked and the word is printed if it is 
    misspelled.
5.  We use fgetc in case there are characters other than letters and apostrophes in the string.
6.  The address of the word and the address of the dictionary will not change.
